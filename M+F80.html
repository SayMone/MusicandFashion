            <span class="impact">M</span>usic stars influenced fashion trends throughout the 1980s. American singers like Madonna introduced sexy trends like visible bra straps and wearing underwear as outerwear. 
            Michael Jackson wore a studded black leather jacket in his sucessful music video (Thriller), young people were seen sporting the same trend.
            Film and television had a similar impact. The movie Flashdance made leg warmers and ripped off-the-shoulder t-shirts very popular.
            The wide-shouldered suits from soap opera Dynasty filtered into fashion, while series Dallas promoted displays of wealth like heavy, glitzy jewlery and sparkling, sequined clothing.</p>

            <span class="impact">F</span>ashion in the 1980s change dramatically with the incoming new music.  “The artists of the 80s found that looking good, showing some skin, having an outlandish outfit or two, and/or wearing more makeup than a circus clown helped to make a lasting impression on impressionable record buyers” (Totally Awesome 80s). 
            You would see girls/women wearing tighter clothing, low cut shirts, big hair, bright colors, baggy pants, jeans, bright and colorful makeup, fake eyelashes, leg warmers, off the shoulder tops, and poufy dresses.  
            The biggest fashion trend of the 80s was jeans.  Women were wearing jeans now not for a political statement, but for a comfy pair of casual pants.  Early in the 80s they were tight, straight legged, creased, and as blue as the night sky. 
            Women hair was teased, crimped, and even colorful.
