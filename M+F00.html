                    incorporating the fusion of trends from several different styles. 
                    By the early 2000s, designers began incorporating more color and pattern into their clothing, using inspiration from vintage clothing of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. 
                    Women's fashion took a more feminine turn as women began wearing denim miniskirts and jackets, halter tops, belly shirts, low-rise jeans, and capri pants. </p>
                <p class="parafix">
                    <span class="impact">T</span>hese pieces originated from pop culture and rap! Britney Spears, Christiana Aguilera, Tyra Banks, etc were major female roles in the fashion trend of this decade. 
                    Tighter fit and cropped shirts were becoming mainstream for women's fashion. These pieces were built upon many ideas of the past. 
                    All the decades history trends had led the 2000's fashion style. The eighties and nineties really influenced the bold and vulgarness colors used; hot pink and cherry red were highly worn. 
                    The clothing fit and style were also influenced from these decades. The idea from the nineties that fashion is being influence from the media really does play a role in the 2000's. 
                    The background of this overall decade of countless jeans, large sunglasses and cropped clothing is just the continuation of the nineties.

                while brands&#39; ability to work with musicians has allowed them new means of attracting customers, 
                increasing consumer goodwill, and maintaining their distinctiveness.

                The celebrity culture has and always will have an influence on fashion as they are constantly in the media. Celebrities are a kind of role models; their looks are studied and copied by a lot of people,
                which makes them very interesting to fashion companies who try to place their products on them. We notice a strong trend in replacing models by Hollywood stars in fashion advertising, 
                like Justin Bieber for Calvin Klein, Victoria Beckham for Giorgio Armani Underwear or Madonna for Louis Vuitton. Fashion brands want to use the glam of Hollywood actresses to project that glam on their products and at the same time to show that luxury is doing well during this economic crisis.</p>
